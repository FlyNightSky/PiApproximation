## Overview

PiApproximationCPP is a C++ program that calculates an approximation of the mathematical constant Pi (Ï€) using a series. The program iteratively refines the approximation and provides insights into the calculations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Approximation**: Tweakable parameters in the code allow you to experiment with different loop values to achieve a closer approximation of Pi.
- **Interactive Output**: The program displays each iteration's details, making it easy to understand the step-by-step process of the approximation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
